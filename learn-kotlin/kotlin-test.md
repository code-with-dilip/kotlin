## Chapter 4 -  Classes, objects, and interfaces

**Interface**
- Create an interface with method declaration and implement that interface in a class.
- Create an implementation method in the interface for the above method.
- Create a class that implements the above interface and override the methods in the implementation class.
- Create an interface and have both of these interfaces be implemented in the above class.
- Call the method in the interface from the implementation class.

**Abstract class**
- Create an abstract class and extend the same using the child class.
  - Add an abstract method and non-abstract method and implement the abstract method in the above declared class.
  - Create a new non-abstract method and implement override the same in the child class.

**Parent-Child classes**
- Create a parent class and extend the parent class using a child class.
- create a method in the parent class and override the method in the child class.

**Visibility Modifiers**

- Explore the same by creating properties in a class with all the different access modifiers ( private , protected , internal)

**Sealed Classes**
- Create a class with sealed and revise on the purpose it is trying to solve.

**Constructors**
- Create a class with default constructor.
- What is a primary and secondary constructor?
  - Examples needs to be coded.
- Create an interface with a property and override the same in the implementation class using a constructor.

**Custom accessor methods(get/set)**
- Create a class with two properties and try to write the custom setter and getter methods.
  - Use the backing field approach.
- Using the **var** type, how do we make sure the value cant be changed.

**data class**
- Explore the data class methods using an example.
  - Equals
  - hashCode
  - copy

**by keyword**

- Create an example that explores the concept of by keyword.

**object**
- Create an example using the object keyword.

**companion**
- Create a companion object for a class.
- Create a companion object with a name.
